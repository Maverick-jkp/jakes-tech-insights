- **Right to Erasure**: Request deletion of your personal data
- **Right to Restrict Processing**: Request limitation of data processing

Since we do not collect or store personal data directly (all data collection is performed by third-party services like Google Analytics and AdSense), exercising these rights should be done through Google's privacy controls linked above.
